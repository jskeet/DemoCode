This repository is a general space for bits and bobs that I (Jon
Skeet) use in public appearances.

It will include sample code from talks, slides, and potentially
code used in blog posts.

Each top-level directory generally represents a post or a talk;
subdirectories will specify Code, Slides, Notes etc.

All code is released under the Apache License 2.0, as found in the
LICENSE.txt file. I'll attempt to remember to include that in a
copyright comment at the top of each file, but if I forget, that's
what it *should* be...
