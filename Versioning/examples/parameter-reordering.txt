# Reordering public method parameters

Changing the order of method parameters is in some ways worse than
simply renaming them. Client code using named arguments will still
compile, but the meaning of the call will change - unless the
reordered parameters have retained their meaning "by name", in which
case any client code using *position* arguments will change meaning.
