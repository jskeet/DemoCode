# Changing a public constant

Any change to a public constant value will only be visible to
clients after they recompile. In most cases this is effectively a
breaking change, and a subtle one at that. However, it's reasonable
to *document* a constant as a default value that may change in
future releases, and that such a change will only be visible after
recompilation.

This applies to the default values for optional parameters as well.
