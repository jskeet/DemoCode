   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\line
\line
   1. Definitions.\line
\line
      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,\line
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.\line
\line
      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by\line
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.\line
\line
      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all\line
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common\line
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,\line
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the\line
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or\line
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the\line
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\line
\line
      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity\line
      exercising permissions granted by this License.\line
\line
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,\line
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation\line
      source, and configuration files.\line
\line
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical\line
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but\line
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,\line
      and conversions to other media types.\line
\line
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or\line
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a\line
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work\line
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\line
\line
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\line
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\line
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\line
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\line
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\line
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\line
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\line
\line
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including\line
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\line
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\line
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\line
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\line
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"\line
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent\line
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to\line
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,\line
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the\line
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but\line
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise\line
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."\line
\line
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\line
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\line
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.\line
\line
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\line
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\line
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\line
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,\line
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\line
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\line
\line
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\line
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\line
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\line
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\line
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\line
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\line
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\line
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\line
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\line
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\line
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\line
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\line
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\line
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\line
      as of the date such litigation is filed.\line
\line
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\line
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\line
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\line
      meet the following conditions:\line
\line
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\line
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\line
\line
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\line
          stating that You changed the files; and\line
\line
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\line
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\line
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\line
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\line
          the Derivative Works; and\line
\line
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its\line
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\line
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\line
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\line
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\line
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\line
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\line
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\line
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\line
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\line
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\line
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\line
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\line
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\line
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\line
          as modifying the License.\line
\line
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\line
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\line
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\line
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\line
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\line
      the conditions stated in this License.\line
\line
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\line
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\line
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\line
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\line
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\line
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\line
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\line
\line
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\line
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\line
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\line
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\line
\line
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\line
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\line
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,\line
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\line
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\line
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\line
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\line
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\line
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\line
\line
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\line
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\line
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\line
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\line
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\line
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\line
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\line
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\line
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\line
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\line
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\line
\line
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\line
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\line
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\line
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\line
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\line
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\line
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\line
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\line
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\line
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\line
\line
   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\line
\line
   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\line
\line
      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\line
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"\line
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include\line
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\line
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a\line
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\line
      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier\line
      identification within third-party archives.\par}
