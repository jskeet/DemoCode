# Yamaha TF Rack protocol

Currently looks very similar to the DM protocol... but rather than assume this,
I'll implement it separately (copying code where appropriate), then see if I
can combine the two and abstract any differences.

## Text protocol details

There's a text protocol which doesn't do everything we need, but might help in terms of names to look for.
